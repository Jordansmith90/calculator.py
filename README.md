# Python Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Add two numbers  
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers  
- Divide two numbers (with error handling for division by zero)

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  
2. Save the code in a file named `calculator.py`.  
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file.  
5. Run the program with:

   python calculator.py

   Or use:

   python3 calculator.py

   (depending on your system)

## How It Works

- The program asks you to choose an operation.
- You then enter two numbers.
- Based on your choice, the program will run the correct function and print the result.

## Example

Select operation:  
1. Add  
2. Subtract  
3. Multiply  
4. Divide  
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1  
Enter first number: 5  
Enter second number: 3  
Result: 8.0

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced functions (exponents, square root)
- Add a GUI version using Tkinter
- Add a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting
